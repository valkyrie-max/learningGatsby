# Repo purely for learning Gatsby

## As the text above suggests, this repo was created to learn basics of Gatsby (and also some graphQL, Node, and Contentful).
This repo doesn't have anything special in it! 

If anyone is interested where to start, I've recently finished [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8t0vNu2fCCM).
It's *slightly* outdated but the issues you ~~might~~ encounter will be easily fixed by doing some quick google search.
